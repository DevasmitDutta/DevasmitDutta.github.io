I am pursuing my Master's at UCLA (Structural Mechanics depth). Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer (Modeling and Simulation), at [JuliaHub, Inc.](https://juliacomputing.com), where I collaborated closely with Dr. [Chris Rackauckas](http://chrisrackauckas.com) and [JuliaSim Team](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliasim/), in developing surrogate models in the domain of computational mechanics and scientific computing.

+  My area of interest lies in the intersection of mechanics, scientific machine learning and finite element methods.
+  Besides, I am also proficient in computational modeling and computer aided design and engineering for analysing 3-D structural elements like beams, columns, plates, truss etc. and deformable solid bodies. 
+  I received my Bachelor's Degree with B. Tech (Honours) in Civil Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bhubaneswar.
+  I belong to Guwahati, Assam, India.
