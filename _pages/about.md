I am a Modeling and Simulation Engineer, at [Julia Computing Inc](https://juliacomputing.com). I collaborate closely with Dr. [Chris Rackauckas](http://chrisrackauckas.com) and [JuliaSim Team](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliasim/), in developing surrogate models in the domain of computational mechanics and scientific computing.

+  My area of interest lies in the intersection of mechanics and scientific machine learning.
+  I received my Bachelor's Degree in Civil Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bhubaneswar.
+  I belong to Guwahati, Assam, India.
